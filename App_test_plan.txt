### **1. Rendering Tests**
- **Verify initial rendering of the application**
  - Ensure the main components (header, footer, etc.) render without crashing.
  - Check that the application title or build selector dropdown is displayed.

- **Check default build based on environment**
  - Ensure the correct default build (`sampleBuild` or `testBuild`) is loaded based on the `NODE_ENV`.

- **Verify rendering of build components**
  - Ensure all build components (e.g., Component A, Component B, etc.) render correctly.
  - Validate that their labels and form fields are displayed as expected.

---

### **2. User Interaction Tests**
- **Build Selector**
  - Simulate selecting a different build from the dropdown and verify that the build updates accordingly.

- **Component Toggling**
  - Simulate expanding/collapsing components and verify that the state updates as expected.
  - Ensure the correct visual changes occur (e.g., toggle arrows or visibility changes).

- **Task Group and Task Visibility**
  - Expand a task group and ensure its tasks are displayed.
  - Collapse the task group and ensure tasks are hidden.

---

### **3. Form Field Interaction**
- **Form field updates**
  - Simulate input changes (e.g., text fields, checkboxes) and verify state updates correctly.
  - Validate proper handling of form fields with `readOnly` or visibility conditions.

---

### **4. Edge Cases and Error Handling**
- **Handle unknown build selection**
  - Attempt to switch to an unknown build and verify that an error is logged or the operation is handled gracefully.

- **Validate readOnly conditions**
  - Ensure the application correctly handles fields without `readOnlyConditions`.
  - Simulate a situation where visibility conditions fail and verify the field is hidden.

---

### **5. State Management**
- **Expanded Components and Task Groups**
  - Verify the state of expanded components and task groups before and after user interaction.

- **Build Context**
  - Validate that the `BuildContext` provides the correct build and supports updates correctly.

---

### **6. Environment-Specific Tests**
- **Development Mode**
  - Verify that development-specific logs or behaviors are enabled.

- **Test Mode**
  - Ensure test-specific builds or behaviors are applied.

- **Production Mode**
  - Validate that production-specific settings are respected.

---

### **7. Snapshot Testing**
- **Static Component Tree**
  - Create snapshots for major states of the app (e.g., default state, expanded components) to detect unintended UI changes.

---

### **8. Integration Tests**
- **Verify component interaction**
  - Ensure that tasks and task groups interact properly with components.
  - Verify updates to parent components when task statuses or form fields change.
